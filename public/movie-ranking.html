</h2>

<h3>Final offer - Lauren Asher</h3>
<p>This is my top favorite book this year.<br>
I gave it 5 stars without even finish it.<br>
I related so much to both of the main characters, I cried A LOT each time i read something about the characters' traumas.<br>
It was so heartbreaking yet beautiful and entertaining.</p>

<h3>The silent patient - Alex Michaelides</h3>
<p>This is my first thriller reading ever. And Just when I thought I knew what was happening I was proven wrong time and time again.<br>
    One of the most well written, thought out, complex thrillers Iâ€™ve read in a long time.<br>
    Incredible descriptive language, cunning storytelling abilities and unbelievable twists.<br>
    Had me on the edge of my seat the WHOLE time.<br></p>

    <h3>The Last Chance Library - Freya Sampson</h3>
    <p>A book for book lovers, bibliophiles, and bookworms.<br>
    It felt so cozy and chilling, happens in small town where all the characters support and love each others.<br>
I've learned many valuable lessons in reading this book and cried A LOT too.<br>
